Disclaimer: Please note that we no longer support older versions of SDKs and Modules. We recommend that the latest versions are used.

iOS SDK
==================

Overview
---------
iOS SDK that can be used to allow the use of the payment gateway within an iOS application.


Requirements
------------
CryptoSwift must be included as a Framework dependency. We have provided CryptoSwift v0.7.2 as part of our SDK however as part of good practice we encourage you to rebuild CryptoSwift and our iOS SDK before use.

**Disclaimer**

Sample code, SDKs and modules have been created as reference material only. Modules are developed and tested against vanilla base platform installs only. Any further module compatibility would need to be tested by the user/merchant/developer. Version support is as shown within the associated VERSION section. All sample code, SDKs and modules offer foundation transaction functionality for merchant and developers to use as a guide and/or to adapt, enhance or otherwise build upon. For the avoidance of doubt, this means that some desired functionality may not be useable or exist. All sample code, SDKs or modules that are used will require complete full end to end testing by the user/merchant/developer. Further to this, use of any sample code, SDKs or modules, Cardstream bears no responsibility for; nor extends any warranty in regard to; nor accepts any liability arising due to any changes or errors in functionality that may result. Developers, merchants or other users of any sample code, SDKs or modules accept these conditions de facto upon usage.
